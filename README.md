Overview:
Develop ReWear, a web-based platform that enables users to exchange unused clothing
through direct swaps or a point-based redemption system. The goal is to promote sustainable
fashion and reduce textile waste by encouraging users to reuse wearable garments instead of
discarding them.

ReWear_1943 is a project built by our team for the Odoo Hackathon.  
It aims to create a sustainable and user-friendly second-hand fashion marketplace, encouraging conscious consumerism and extending the life cycle of clothing.
